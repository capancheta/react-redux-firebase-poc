React-Redux-Firebase App (Updated)

Updated version of https://github.com/iamshaunjp/React-Redux-Firebase-App made by NetNinja in the tutorials at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9iWstfXntcj8f-dFZ4UtlN3

- React 16.8 (I need this, but you can try to up the version)
- React-router (kept at v5, mostly because i cant figure out how to move .history.push() to the hooks-heavy v6)

All latest as of last modified date:

- Redux
- React-redux
- redux-thunl
- React-redux-firebase
- redux-firestore
- Firebase (9.6, but used in compat mode, because i cant figure out how to tell redux-firestore to use the new getFirestore() call)
